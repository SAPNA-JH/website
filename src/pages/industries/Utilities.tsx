            Utilities are at the vanguard of the energy revolution, which is
            driving major change in the business as people everywhere turn to
            more sustainable fuels and widespread electrification. More and more
            homeowners and businesses are opting for eco-friendly dwellings and
            workplaces, and they demand cutting-edge services from their energy
            suppliers.

            Customerâ€™s attention is being drawn away from incumbent utilities
            and toward newcomers offering novel services as the energy sector
            decentralizes. Governments spend huge sums updating the grid and
            increasing energy independence, yet the aging infrastructure and the
            introduction of new technology only make matters worse.
