        Customerâ€™s attention is being drawn away from incumbent utilities and toward newcomers offering novel services as the energy sector decentralizes.
         Governments spend huge sums updating the grid and increasing energy independence, yet the aging infrastructure and the introduction of new 
         technology only make matters worse.
